# ballroom-event-hub
Create a web app using React and JavaScript to aggregate and display upcoming ballroom events in the U.S. Users can filter events by region, build personalized event tours, and track point-earning opportunities for “Of The Year” awards. This project will involve scraping data from various sources and presenting it in an easy-to-use interface.
